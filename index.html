        <h1>Rulani collets six points in 5 games at Wydad</h1>
        <img src="./images/rulani.webp">
        <p>Rulani Mokwena's appointment as head coach of Wydad Casablanca was met with significant anticipation. <br> 
            Known for his tactical acumen and previous successes in South African football, many believed he would bring a fresh perspective to one of Africa's most storied clubs. <br>
             However, the early stages of his tenure have been anything but smooth, with the team garnering only six points from their first five matches in the league.
            A Rocky Start
            Wydad's season began with high expectations, but the reality on the pitch has been disappointing. Six points from five matches is far from the standard expected at a club of Wydad's stature, which boasts a rich history and a passionate fanbase. <br>
             The team’s struggles have raised questions about tactics, player selection, and overall morale.</p>

                    A Historic Transfer
                    The deal, finalized just days after Mofokeng's standout performance in the final against Stellenbosch, showcases the player’s rapid ascent in the football world. His contributions throughout the season, highlighted by his exceptional skills, vision, and tactical awareness, caught the eye of several international clubs, but it was Liverpool that ultimately secured his signature.
                    
                    Mofokeng's transfer fee of R120 million is a monumental achievement for South African football, illustrating the growing recognition and valuation of talent emerging from the continent. This sale not only elevates Mofokeng's career but also sets a new standard for future transfers involving South African players.</p>
